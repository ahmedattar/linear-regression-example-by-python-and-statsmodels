# linear regression example by python-and-statsmodels

# What  is [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) , [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) ?
  - those are python libraries used for data analysis and data science purposes
  - to get tutorial about them press [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html) for numpy, and [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/ols.html) for statsmodels for linear regression using Ordinary Least Squares method.
  
# What is the project about ?
- the project consists of implementation of small exercise of the attached data in csv file to output the coefficients of the model using python and using statsmodels library in python.
